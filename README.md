# Minstrel J

**Minstrel J** is a FLOSS hybrid reading app specifically designed for Audio-eBooks

* Version: 3.0.1J (Japanese Edition)
* Date: 2016-05-05
* Developed by: [ReadBeyond][rb] (modified by naofum)
* Lead Developer: [Alberto Pettarin][ap]
* License: GPL Version 3
* Web Page: [Minstrel][webpage]
* Contact: [minstrel@readbeyond.it](mailto:minstrel@readbeyond.it)

## Installing the App

If you just want to install the app on your phone/tablet,
you can download [**Menestrello**][menestrello],
the official stable release of **Minstrel**
maintained by ReadBeyond, using:

1. [Google Play][googleplay] (Android devices)
2. [Android APK][apk] (Android devices, manual installation)


## Developing the App

### System Requirements

1. [Android SDK][androidsdk] (Android) and/or [Xcode][xcode] (iOS)
2. [Apache Cordova 8.0.0][cordova]

If you want to build the Android APK from command line,
make sure the Android SDK is in your `$PATH`
so that `cordova` can run it.

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository and enter the `cordova` directory:
    
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/readbeyond/minstrel.git
    $ cd minstrel/cordova
    ```

2. Create the Cordova project directory:
   
    ```bash
    $ bash create_minstrel.sh
    or
    $ bash create_minstrel.sh android
    $ bash create_minstrel.sh ios
    ```

   The first command will create both versions of the app,
   the last two commands will create only the specified version.

3. Build the Android version:
    
    ```bash
    $ cd minstrel/
    $ bash build.sh
    ```

    will build the app and copy the generated APK into `/tmp/`.

4. Build the iOS version:

    ```bash
    $ open minstrel/platforms/ios/Minstrel.xcodeproj
    ```
    
    will open the generated project in Xcode.

### Contributing

If you are able to contribute code directly,
that's great!
Feel free to open a pull request,
we will be glad to have a look at it.

Please make your code consistent with
the existing code base style
and test your contributed code
before opening the pull request.

Create a new branch (e.g., `myfeature`)
for each logically-independent feature
you want to contribute.

Any contribution adding or altering
the JS/native plugin interfaces
must work for both Android and iOS
before the contribution can be merged
into the master branch of the app.
This policy ensures that both platforms
are supported and have the same features
at any given time.
Improvements to the existing native plugins
that do not alter the JS/native interfaces
are not subject to this rule.
